# Exercise 7 - BDD & Gherkin Syntax 

## Exercise 7.1 (10 Points): User Stories Definition

Use cases from Exercise2/Lab2 were used to create these feature files:

- [Create task](../../backend/focusflow/src/test/resources/features/create_task.feature)
- [Remind for task due](../../backend/focusflow/src/test/resources/features/remind_for_task_due.feature)
- [Task status](../../backend/focusflow/src/test/resources/features/task_status.feature)
- [Update Task](../../backend/focusflow/src/test/resources/features/update_task.feature)
- [User registration](../../backend/focusflow/src/test/resources/features/user_registration.feature) was only implemented to test Cucumber

Cucumber dependencies were added in the [pom.xml](../../backend/focusflow/pom.xml) file
